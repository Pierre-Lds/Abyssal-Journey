# Abyssal Journey

### Description

Abyssal Journey is a plateform video-game developped in Qt.
This is currently the first release.
Made with QT Creator 4.11.2 and Qt 5.14.2


### Notes :

* The sound doesn't work in the release, I tried to include .dll files but it doesn't work. If you want to hear ambience sounds, you can run it in QtCreator.
* I designed all textures and music by myself, then there's no credits.
* You can find all .h and .cpp in abyssaljourneyv1 (folder) > release (folder) and the makefiles in abyssaljourney (folder).

### Prerequisite

Nothing to launch the game.
A code editor to see the code
A QT version + QTCreator/XMing+an IDE

You don't have to install something to launch the game


### Launch the game
